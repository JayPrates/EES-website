# Description
High Noon was the final project of the bootcamp and required us to put into practice all 
we learned in the course of the 9 week curriculum. To do so we developed a MERN stack
web application from scratch and we fully deployed it. High Noon is a productivity app
that was designed with ADHD individuals in mind. This shows in the welcoming UI choices
that don't overwhelm the user with information nor options.


# Functionalities

## CRUD
The user is able to perform all CRUD operations on the tasks/skills/habits that he wishes to track.

## Stats
In order to have a visual representation of the user's progress when acecessing stats the user will be present with a doughnut diagram (for tasks and skills) and a list of dates for skills, so that they can then evaluate which areas need improving in their productivity journey.

# Live Demo
The final version of this Express based full-stack app 
is in the following link:
